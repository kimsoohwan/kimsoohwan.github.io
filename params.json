{"name":"Soohwan Kim","tagline":"","body":"### Biography\r\nI am a PhD candidate in College of Engineering and Computer Science at [The Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Dr. Jonghyuk Kim](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/kim-j), [Dr. Hongdong Li](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/) and [Dr. Edwin Bonilla](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Edwin.Bonilla/). \r\nMy PhD research topic is Bayesian non-parametric approaches to 3D mapping and reconstruction. To be more specific, I apply Gaussian and Dirichlet Processes to build occupancy maps and to reconstruct surfaces given observations from range sensors such as laser sensors and cameras.\r\n\r\nI received my MS degree in Computer Science with Specialization in Intelligent Robotics at [University Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/) in 2004 and BS degree in Mechanical and Aerespace Engineering at [Seoul National University](http://www.useoul.edu/) in 2003. \r\n\r\nI was a research scientist in vision-based mobile robot navigation at [Korea Institute of Science and Technology](http://eng.kist.re.kr/) from 2007 to 2011 and a researcher in physics-based character animation at [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute](http://www.etri.re.kr/eng) from 2005 to 2006.\r\n\r\n### Research Interests\r\nMachine Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics\r\n\r\n### Selected Publications\r\n- **Soohwan Kim** and Jonghyuk Kim, \"Occupancy Mapping and Surface Reconstruction using Local Gaussian Processes with Kinect Sensors,\" _IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics_, Vol. 43, Iss. 5, pp. 1335 - 1346, 2013.
